              "11    On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.\n",

                                           on xxxxxxxx i received an advertisement via email that new chase customers could get  for opening a new chase total checking account with the set up direct deposit and an additional  for new chase savings customers who open a chase savings account and deposit a total of  or more in new money within  business days and maintain a  balance for  days i careful read all of the disclosures and was sure to follow all steps correctly to be eligible for both offers to receive the combined  offer i opened my accounts online on chase s website on xxxxxxxx to date  xxxxxxxx  i still have not received either offer despite numerous attempts to work with chase employees to resolve this  on xxxxxxxx i deposited  into the savings account well within the  business days of account opening  when i contacted chase at the  end of xxxx to discuss my concern i called the customer service line and spoke with a supervisor he informed me there was nothing he could do without the coupon code i explained i do not have the coupon code  at the time  and the call ended i later found the coupon code and called back during this call a lady informed me that regardless of having the coupon code there was nothing that could be done to investigateresolve this she then told me the reason i did not receive the bonus offers for opening either account is because i did not enter the coupon code at the time i opened the account online that was the only reason i did not receive the bonus amounts \\n\\nduring the online account opening process chase s website stated  if you open the account online your coupon code will be automatically applied  furthermore the email i received  will be attached for reference  specifically states  your coupon code will be automatically applied account  s  subject to approval  as a result two sources confirmed that the coupon code would be automatically applied therefore i dont recall entering the coupon because it was being added automatically for me \\n\\ni am very frustrated with my chase experience and the lack of payment of these bonus offers i rightfully earned after phone customer service supervisors told me there was nothing they could do i contacted local branch management they advised me to contact the phone customer service and said they could not help me i am very upset about this entire

debit card tuesday  on thursday  i went into a branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday  upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday xxxxxxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only now chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently unfortunately this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments etc i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document this situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with me professionally thank you   \n",

rapid reward points and a companion pass after spending  xxxx in the first three months i followed a link provided to open the credit card now they are saying that the offer was over at the time and they have given me a much less valuable signup promotion that doesnt include the companion pass the companion pass was the entire reason we signedup and the reason the card was promoted to me they have informed me that the offer was from jan   and that my cc shows approval on the xxxx xxxx the supervisor i spoke to said that they specifically dont send out offer details to confirm your offer when you sign up  thus denying me evidence  but also that they cant fix it without this evidence i feel that their offer and subsequent actions are fraudulent and constitute deceptive practices when i spoke to xxxx they acknowledged that it doesnt seem right but stated that chase is the one who has to authorize the deals so the error was definitely on their end   \n",

to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than  of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged this all happened no later than  after putting in the application on  notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on  this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error   \n",

like its going out of style be careful  the marketing is not clear if you already have a swa chase personal card do not apply for the new one online this has sent me through a xxxx triangle wasting my time and therefore money \\n\\nit appears in the middle of  chase expanded their undisclosed  rule to include all cobranded cards not just swa yet the marketing machine continues to ignore this policy and the agents on the phone are not well trained i am contacting the credit bureau bc two of the cards opened are not mine  that is the silver lining here \\n\\nhowever the issue with incessant marketing of their branded cards to customers plus this confusing  rule and lack of agent phone training is false advertising the information is still relatively opaque as chase never comments on the  rule but multiple reader and community data points suggest denials due to  for cards previously exempt \\n\\ncfpb staff please help educate consumers and hold the big banks accountable for deceptive trade practices i do not believe this is intentional on chase s part but the second to last agent did encourage me to file a complaint here so be it \\n\\nthank you \\n\\nxxxx   \n",

                                i recently called to ask chase bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info  they showed that on the xxxx of  i was very late on my bill and owed xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the xxxx to being it to xxxx \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for  later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late for not paying what accrued to be  the guy representing chase agreed with me that they

               i made a purchase of  on xxxxxxxx i made payments of  on xxxxxxxx and  on xxxxxxxx the minimum payment was  the closing date was xxxxxxxx  please see attached statement  that statement  xxxxxxxx  shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of  on xxxxxxxx i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xxxxxxxx \\nhowever when i got the xxxx statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of  i have a promotional balance xxxx  in xxxx of  in xxxx the promotional balance was   a difference of  \\n\\napparently the payment  above the minimum payment required by chase  i thought would be applied to the purchase     was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance \\n\\nrespectfully xxxx xxxx xxxx   \n",

the files and told xxxx that chase said i was bankrupt and to terminate the processes xxxx did and did not pay chase any longer i have received no communication from anyone on this i was going to open a checking account at chase today and noticed that my mortgage had not been paid i called and they said that xxxx will not pay them and have terminated me to bankruptcy which i am not in since the mortgage holder would know after much pain i was able to get a mortgage verification letter sent to xxxx so they can restart my payments however i had to make a complete payment pay late fees and have now late payments that will be on my credit file and payment history \\n\\nxxxx was negligent with the files transfer and xxxx was also negligent by not actually reading the date of the data and contacting the mortgage company to verify the sack of errant files that were delivered \\n\\nwhat can be done i have now marks on my credit report and had to pay fees for something that was done to me no one will give me the records although they are about me and my finances i thought that i am entitled to all records about myself \\n\\ni am beyond upset and should have something done to remove the late payment recorded on me to the credit bureaus and filed to remove when a manual mortgage is run xxxx must have been really evil and xxxx doesnt really read what they are given or even contact the person xxxx did not let me know they were changing services \\n\\ni can provide only the mortgage verification from chase as the rest of the businesses refuse to provide written or electronic data they say that they only the computers transferred the files and were processed evidently xxxx did not use a human review process to read only accept checked fields of bad records   \n",

service phone number listed on the back of my card  payments are due on the xxxx of the month  to learn that i was  days past due and explained that auto payment had been requested on my end via the online tool which they explained could take  business cycles but did not appear to have gone into affect \\n\\nadditionally i learned that they did not have the correct contact information in the system but instead had reached out to old email addresses and telephone contact information from previous accounts that had auto populated instead of using the correct information i had provided at the time of application \\n\\ni made a payment by phone immediately to payoff the entire balance requested auto payment to be setup and confirmed on their end as well as requested that the current contact information be setup in the system to avoid missing communications in the future \\n\\nthey made notation in the account of the challenge reversed all late charges and ensured me that the late

payment in full and notation that i would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which i have received this reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end \\n\\nall subsequent payments have been made on time and as of xxxxxxxx the account has a  balance due to charges made after payment in full \\n\\nin xxxxxxxx i received an email from xxxx alert service that i subscribe to that my credit score had decreased from xxxx to xxxx i opened the xxxx file which stated a late payment was reported by chase for xxxx i filed a dispute and in xxxx received an email from xxxx  stating the dispute had been resolved upon further investigation it noted that the negative reporting was not being removed \\n\\ni contacted chase xxxx visa explained the negative reporting the agent reviewed the notes in the account and verified that they had made notation of the banking error due to the internet site not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges they stated that the  credit bureau unit  was not currently open and requested i call back the next day and request to speak to the unit as they would be able to to correct the information \\n\\ni followed the advice and spoke with xxxx cbu specialist in the xxxx mo call center after a long period of discussion xxxx informed me that there was nothing that he could do to update the file and remove the late payment reporting to the bureau \\n\\nafter requesting all notation on my file he advised i send a fax to the  business office  at  xxxx  xxxx but that there was not a live person to speak with nor an email that i could send the request to \\n\\ni asked to speak to his supervisor at which point he transferred me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to xxxx customer service \\n\\nin speaking with xxxx in customer service i believed that i was still speaking to the credit bureau department i recalled all events she confirmed the notation in the account additionally i advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on xxxxxxxx my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all chase accounts i was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account i received a screen that stated that i needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbersemail that were prepopulated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information i had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once i was able to gain access into the account i confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the default contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information \\n\\ni explained to her that when i tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account she assisted with updating on her end had me log out and log back in to confirm that the correct information was now showing on my end as the default contact information \\n\\ngiven all of the challenges with the site that have been noted extensively as well as the notation of the banking challenge due to the malfunction of the auto payment setup i asked if she would be able to assist with removing the negative reporting at this point she advised me that i had been transferred out of the credit bureau department and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done i explained that i had already spoken with xxxx in that department and that i was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her she stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to  days to provide a call back \\n\\nshe then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named xxxx explained the situation and xxxx told her that there  was nothing that he could do to assist  \\n\\ni have never been late with a payment across all accounts i have spent numerous hours trying to resolve this matter with jp morgan chasexxxx as a result of chasexxxx xxxx it appears that my diligence to setup auto payment  provide current contact information for my account were not feasible and will now have a significant impact on the cost of credit that i will be seeking for a new home purchase mortgage given that my credit rating went from  outstanding  to  good  and is the main tool used by lenders for determining interest rates offered \\n\\ni am reaching out to you in hopes that you will be able to   assist with restoring my credit due to bankingit error on the part of the credit card issuer   by sharing my story prevent another person from being lured into getting a credit card from chase and have to deal with the same challenges i have faced   \n",

\\n\\nxxxx  mid xxxx my case was assigned to xxxx in the executive office we spent roughly  weeks before either one of us spoke on the phone  although she had left a handful of voicemails i first spoke with xxxx on friday xxxxxxxx i told her about the multiple claims that were opened against an account i had since closed she claimed she only received two of the claims against the account after speaking with me she assured me she was going to  investigate  all the claims made that were made beginning at the end of xxxx on xxxxxxxx i noticed multiple payments being deducted from my chase checking account in the description all i saw were numbers on xxxxxxxx i called xxxx to see why money was being debited from my account of course all i got was xxxx s voicemail i left a message requesting a return call by xxxxxxxx i still had not received a return call i called xxxx once again because money was still being debited from my account this time i got a hold of xxxx her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd she told me that while they were  investigating  these open claims money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it finally on xxxxxxxx i received a voicemail from xxxx to call her as soon as possible i returned her call once school was dismissed for the day it was at that point that xxxx told me they closed their  investigation  of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision when asked what research they used to complete their  investigation  xxxx became short and told me i would have to subpoena the information at that point i hung up because i felt that it was a lose lose situation   \n",

xxxxxxxx and tuesday   i used chase quick pay with xxxx to submit two different payments   security deposit and   month rent  that was required to move into a rental i was supposed to move into on saturday xxxxxxxx the home owner then tried to get more money out of me and i finally pieced together i was being scammed \\n\\nsince xxxx was offered through my chase bank online portal i thought it was part of chase and i would be afforded protections \\n\\nafter i realized i was being scammed i contacted chase and got the run around finally ending up talking to xxxx in the chase claims dept  xxxx  i was told xxxx not a part of chase and since my payments were pier to pier there was no obligation on the part of chase to help get my money back xxxx said i should have read the fine print and xxxx should only be used to send money to people i know \\n\\nif that is the case then chase should have had an upfront notice stating  you are aware that scam artists and pirates prefer xxxx because theres no recourse after they get your money and chase doesnt care  \\n\\nive done a lot of research on xxxx since getting scammed and i think it is bs that chase chose to partner with xxxx the number one tool used by scam artists because theres basically no verification required to set up an account and that chase promotes it as their own internal payment system giving the illusion id be afforded the same protections i get with the other chase family of products \\n\\nim also very upset that chase made it this easy for this scam artist to now have my personal information   \n",

                                                  i have a chase sapphire reserved card and the payment is due the first of the month to pay the bill i can go through the chase credit card website and it automatically draws the payment from my bank account the payment normally takes several hours to be completed although they do state that it can take up to two business days i normally schedule the payment two days in advance of when my payment is due to ensure that it is received on time taking into account weekends and how many business days there are before the first of the month \\n\\ni have made payments for this credit card on time for every single month however on at least four instances the credit card is saying payments have been late and they charge a late fee and interest charge for the first two instances i know i made the payments on time but the company said it was posted late and so they charged fees when i found out i called the credit card company and spoke to their customer service representative and eventually after talking to supervisors they acknowledged that their system inappropriately delayed when the payment was shown as posting and so they refunded the late fees and interest charged more recently for this past xxxx it occurred again and then for xxxx i went online and made the payment but when i got my statement for xxxx recently its saying that the payment was never received and so it charged late fees and interested for both xxxx and xxxx i am tying to talk to them to get them to address these situations as well and am hoping they will resolve it but its now seeming to be a pattern and i have heard from others who have this credit card  and other credit cards  that they experience this as well i dont know if its just errors in these companies  systems or if it is purposeful as a way for them to collect late fees and interest charges from unsuspecting customers i am lucky in that i am familiar with consumer protections laws and so know how to call them and challenge them but i worry that many consumers wont notice or wont know how to challenge them and so just pay them i am wondering if others have complained about this to cfpb and so perhaps it is in fact a pattern that requires investigation thank you for your time and consideration and for all you do to help protect consumers across the country   \n",

are worth at least  \\n\\naround    months ago  when i tried to access my chase ultimate rewards account  or even activate the   bonus on chase freedom  i would get shown this page that says  we are unable to complete your request at this time   image attached as well   xxxx  xxxx at first i thought it was just a temporary error  which isnt uncommon for chase  but after  weeks this was still happening so i called customer support they opened a ticket got escalated to their tech team but when i would call back to find out what happened they told me that the case had been closed this happened  times and each call has taken a lot of time to explain the situation and verify a bunch of information \\n\\ngoing from ultimaterewardscom and chasecom have the  same result \\n\\nim not able to use these points by phone either because the operators for the travel center are not able to access my accountpoints neither \\n\\nive tried every browser both xxxx and xxxx computers and the xxxx chase phone application they all send me to the page that says  we are unable to complete your request at this time  on xxxxxxxx i looked up some people that work in ultimate rewards on xxxx and cold called a vp of customer relations he acted like he was helpful at first and we exchanged some emails he eventually said i can buy a flighthotel using chase sapphire and if i give him the details he will deduct the appropriate points and credit my credit card for the purchase \\n\\nlong story short he wasnt able to fix anything \\n\\ni can see that im still collecting points but i havent been able to access it \\n\\ni travel a lot and its become a huge inconvenience that im not able to access these points which i intended to use for travel i need to get this issue resolved asap   \n",

night at the hotel in xxxx  for friday  \\n transportation to the hotel  for friday  \\n private city tour of xxxx  for friday  \\n xxxx xxxx private tour  for friday  \\ngrand total of  reason for not receiving the services was that xxxx cancelled the flight from xxxx to xxxx for mechanical reasons \\ni started the process for the of the refund thru xxxx xxxx i was told by xxxx xxxx that i needed to request the refund thru xxxx which i did i requested the refund and was told by xxxx that since i didnt purchase the ticket directly thru them but it was done thru a  party i needed to go thru xxxx xxxx i went back to them and was told that they will not refund me \\ni then started a dispute with my credit card chase visa for the charges the credit card dispute department closed my dispute saying that the vendor stated that i did receive the services which is not true but my credit card closed the dispute after several attempts by me to reopen the dispute   \n",

website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank \\n\\ni contacted chase via a secured message on  explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for \\n\\ni called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter \\n\\nduring this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service

roommate was stealing my chase debit card and drivers license  pretending to be me and withdrawing money from my account he admitted that he figured out my pin because it happens to be the same as my phone password \\n\\nhe also admitted that he would sneak into my room while i was sleeping and put the card back before i woke up \\n\\nhe apologized but says he spent the money i tried to dispute this with chase but they claim that since my debit card pin number was used that they cant prove it wasnt me \\n\\nalthough they advertise that i have   fraud protection they refuse to give me my money back \\n\\natm withdrawl  xxxxxxxx   atm withdrawl  xxxxxxxx   atm withdrawl  xxxxxxxx   atm withdrawl  xxxxxxxx   atm withdrawl  xxxxxxxx   atm withdrawl  xxxxxxxx     \n",

xxxx xxxx on xxxxxxxx the merchant stated that my order was cancelled and the refund would return to the original method of payment in five business days the original method of payment was a chase credit card that i had since closed on xxxxxxxx i sent a secure message to chase requesting that the refund be transferred to one of my open chase cards i also followed up with a phone call that same week and the representative i spoke to informed me that funds that are sent to closed accounts would be sent via check through the mail and could not be transferred to any existing accounts on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase indicating that my  disputed charge  would remain on my account and  the merchant is not willing to credit your account  i followed up with a phone call to chase describing that this was a refund not a dispute the representative informed me that they did not have access to closed accounts i explained my previous attempts via phone and message to locate these funds they informed me to try to send a secure message again this time emphasizing that the refund i am looking for is on a closed account and that the previous representative may have looked for the refund on a different account on xxxxxxxx i sent another secure message with this information as well as the emails i received from the merchant about the refund  see attachment   on xxxxxxxx i received a letter from chase with similar language about  the merchant is not willing to credit your account  and  we consider the charge valid based on the results of our research   see attachment  on xxxxxxxx i followed up with the merchant xxxx xxxx requesting an alternate way to receive this refund given that my credit card company apparently can not locate the funds on xxxxxxxx the merchant provided a screenshot with their records that the funds had been refunded  see attachment  this was my last exchange trying to resolve this between the credit card or the merchant   \n",

twice for this transaction i placed a disputes case with chase bank on  when i noticed the charge on my account i called back on sunday  about the provisional credit for the charge and again on monday  i was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided i used my debt card on monday  then tried to use it again but it would not work i went to chase bank on xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx xxxx nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity i was shocked because i had not reported fraud on my account i later found out that i was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from xxxx xxxx  xxxx i later contacted xxxx xxxx  xxxx again and was told that they did see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within     days i contacted the chase disputes department again on monday xxxxxxxx  and explained thaxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx would credit my account and that i did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim the escalation manager did not care and told me that chase decision on closing my account was final i had been a customer of chase for xxxx   years my character has been challenged by the disputes agents and i consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander \\n\\ni am not seeking to keep my account open with chase but i also do not want chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily \\n\\nonce again i do not want chase to have the checking account that i had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by chase \\n\\ni did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past   \n",

 s to a nonexistent address one that has never been used or reported by me or my cosigner the address they used is a splicing of  separate addresses in  different cities in the same state this cancellation was done after chase claims they made multiple attempts to contact my cosigner for repayment an arguable fact as my cosigner has absolutely no knowledge or paperwork to that affect though chase has her correct address and phone number  i have confirmed this through phone calls with chase \\n\\nmy cosigner is a retired account and as such she keeps every scrap of paper concerning loans and financing she receives and she has no record of the loans chase reported cancellednor do i so i contacted chase to request copies of the original loan contracts as proof that the loans are in fact mine these loans do not show up on either of our credit reports so we are questioning where they came from \\n\\nmy first phone call to chase was on xxxxxxxx i spoke to a woman named xxxx in the irs notice department she was  unable to provide further information  because chase no longer directly deals with student loans i could not get a direct number into chase so i contacted our local chase bank branch and spoke to xxxx on xxxxxxxx she took my information and sent an internal email in an attempt to either get the information i was seeking or to put me in touch with the people who could \\n\\nwhen i hadnt heard anything i reached back out to xxxx on xxxxxxxx she was helping someone else so my call was taken by the branch manager who took all of my information and filed a grievance on my behalf through chase s complaint and compliance department \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i was contacted by xxxx  id  xxxx  with the complaint and compliance department she said my information had been given to the research team who would look into the loans when they completed their search she would be back in touch with what they found \\n\\non xxxxxxxx xxxx called me back and said they had located specifics on the loans in question and directed me to the chase recovery and loan specialist department who would then be able to provide the appropriate documentation i was seeking \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i contacted the loan specialist department and spoke to a woman who confirmed the loan numbers amounts and cosigner i asked why these loans were not showing up on any credit report and she stated that the loans  drop off as soon as they are cancelled  a statement that is absolutely false i requested copies of the original loan contracts and she said she would have them sent to me with no issue the contract was post marked xxxxxxxx and arrived xxxxxxxx however the contract she sent was not the correct loan contract it was not the correct dates amount or loan number\\n\\nrealizing that i wasnt getting anywhere my cosigner contacted chase on xxxxxxxx attempting to get the information i requested the man she spoke to again confirmed details but instead of sending contracts referred her to the irs for further questions \\n\\non xxxxxxxx my cosigner again contacted chase to directly request contract copies for these loans on this phone call she was told she was not a cosigner and therefore could not be given any information or sent any contracts \\n\\non xxxxxxxx i contacted chase again and spoke to loan specialist   xxxx who confirmed that my cosigner was in fact on the loans she said the original loans were taken out between xxxx she said loans were charged off xxxxxxxx letters sent in xxxx and reported cancelled in xxxx this time she could not confirm the address the  s were sent to she said she had no idea where the address came from  she also corrected previous information given and confirmed that these loans should be on our credit reports  she offered to send me to the credit reporting dept to  fix  the non reported loans  i declined  she said she had requested copies of the original contracts as well as copies of the  s for these loans to be sent to me in  business days unfortunately the only documentation she sent were  s with the wrong address i have still yet to receive a single piece of paper relating to these loan contracts\\n\\nit has been  months numerous phones calls and misinformation and i can not get any tangible proof that the loans reported cancelled on my name and social are in fact my loans and my responsibility i once again called chase on xxxxxxxx and asked to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge who could give me a definitive answer and send me concrete proof of these loans i was transferred to a voicemail left a very specific message with appropriate contact information and i have yet to receive a phone call back as of xxxxxxxx even though the voicemail greeting specifically states that a callback will take place within  business hours   \n",

contact with chase representatives as xxxx representatives would handle it as of friday xxxxxxxx i  have been receiving calls from xxxx xxxx formerly known as xxxx xxxx xxxx they are a credit collections company used by chase on friday i received  calls on both xxxx and xxxx i received one call and today on xxxx i have received three calls one of these calls was a call to my office asking to speak to me however i was in a meeting the man who called was very aggressive to my boss who answered i checked with a lawyer and learned that repeated calls on the same day and calling my work are illegal practices calling my place of work puts my job at risk as stated before i have provided the number for xxxx xxxx xxxx whom they are supposed to be working with   \n",

                                  chase sent me an email today with the innocuous title  important information regarding changes to your chase account   they often use similar titles for ads and other communications  \\n\\nin it they force me into binding arbitration  despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them  \\n\\nthey do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequences  many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out  and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out \\n\\nthis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out \\n\\nthis is blatant malpractice by chase   \n",

                                    on xxxxxxxx I receive an advertisement via email that new chase customer could get   for open a new chase total checking account with the set up direct deposit and an additional   for new chase saving customer who open a chase saving account and deposit a total of   or more in new money within   business day and maintain a   balance for   day I careful read all of the disclosure and be sure to follow all step correctly to be eligible for both offer to receive the combine   offer I open my account online on chase s website on xxxxxxxx to date   xxxxxxxx   I still have not receive either offer despite numerous attempt to work with chase employee to resolve this   on xxxxxxxx I deposit   into the saving account well within the   business day of account opening   when I contact chase at the   end of xxxx to discuss my concern I call the customer service line and speak with a supervisor he inform I there be nothing he could do without the coupon code I explain I do not have the coupon code   at the time   and the call end I later find the coupon code and call back during this call a lady inform I that regardless of have the coupon code there be nothing that could be do to investigateresolve this she then tell I the reason I do not receive the bonus offer for opening either account be because I do not enter the coupon code at the time I open the account online that be the only reason I do not receive the bonus amount \\n\\n during the online account opening process chase s website state   if you open the account online your coupon code will be automatically apply   furthermore the email I receive   will be attach for reference   specifically state   your coupon code will be automatically apply account   s   subject to approval   as a result two source confirm that the coupon code would be automatically apply therefore I do not recall enter the coupon because it be be add automatically for I \\n\\n I be very frustrated with my chase experience and the lack of payment of these bonus offer I rightfully earn after phone customer service supervisor tell I there be nothing they could do I contact local branch management they advise I to contact the phone customer service and say they could not help I I be very upset about this entire experience I want to be compensate   to cover the   and   offer I should have earn I

  xxxx in the first three month I follow a link provide to open the credit card now they be say that the offer be over at the time and they have give I a much less valuable signup promotion that do not include the companion pass the companion pass be the entire reason we signedup and the reason the card be promote to I they have inform I that the offer be from jan    and that my cc show approval on the xxxx xxxx the supervisor I speak to say that they specifically do not send out offer detail to confirm your offer when you sign up   thus deny I evidence   but also that they can not fix it without this evidence I feel that their offer and subsequent action be fraudulent and constitute deceptive practice when I speak to xxxx they acknowledge that it do not seem right but state that chase be the one who have to authorize the deal so the error be definitely on their end   \n",

card previously exempt \\n\\n cfpb staff please help educate consumer and hold the big bank accountable for deceptive trade practice I do not believe this be intentional on chase s part but the second to last agent do encourage I to file a complaint here so be it \\n\\n thank you \\n\\n xxxx   \n",

I be very late on my bill and owe xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finish with the bill I pay that amount on the same day the xxxx to be it to xxxx \\n\\n they say that I try to make another payment for   later that same day and in a few day that come back as a return payment \\n\\n the man on the phone state to I that if the payment go through then it would have mean that I have a credit on my account for xxxx since I do not owe anything \\n\\n they update my account with charge and late fee from the return payment that I have no idea of since I think I pay off the entire amount they report to the credit bureau that I be   day late for not pay what accrue to be   the guy represent chase agree with I that they be in the wrong for charge I the fee and say they would remove they I still have   in the negative that they be say that I owe in the mobile app \\n\\n additionally because they report I be late my credit score drop   point when I call back to ask if they can report that they make a mistake they say I would have to do that on my own I think that s xxxx   \n",

quick pay with xxxx to submit two different payment    security deposit and    month rent   that be require to move into a rental I be suppose to move into on saturday xxxxxxxx the home owner then try to get more money out of I and I finally piece together I be be scamme \\n\\n since xxxx be offer through my chase bank online portal I think it be part of chase and I would be afford protection \\n\\n after I realize I be be scamme I contact chase and get the run around finally end up talk to xxxx in the chase claim dept   xxxx   I be tell xxxx not a part of chase and since my payment be pier to pier there be no obligation on the part of chase to help get my money back xxxx say I should have read the fine print and xxxx should only be use to send money to people I know \\n\\n if that be the case then chase should have have an upfront notice state   you be aware that scam artist and pirate prefer xxxx because there s no recourse after they get your money and chase do not care  \\n\\n I ve do a lot of research on xxxx since getting scamme and I think it be bs that chase choose to partner with xxxx the number one tool use by scam artist because there s basically no verification require to set up an account and that chase promote it as their own internal payment system give the illusion I d be afford the same protection I get with the other chase family of product \\n\\n I m also very upset that chase make it this easy for this scam artist to now have my personal information   \n",

                                         I have a chase sapphire reserve card and the payment be due the first of the month to pay the bill I can go through the chase credit card website and it automatically draw the payment from my bank account the payment normally take several hour to be complete although they do state that it can take up to two business day I normally schedule the payment two day in advance of when my payment be due to ensure that it be receive on time take into account weekend and how many business day there be before the first of the month \\n\\n I have make payment for this credit card on time for every single month however on at least four instance the credit card be say payment have be late and they charge a late fee and interest charge for the first two instance I know I make the payment on time but the company say it be post late and so they charge fee when I find out I call the credit card company and speak to their customer service representative and eventually after talk to supervisor they acknowledge that their system inappropriately delay when the payment be show as posting and so they refund the late fee and interest charge more recently for this past xxxx it occur again and then for xxxx I go online and make the payment but when I get my statement for xxxx recently its saying that the payment be never receive and so it charge late fee and interested for both xxxx and xxxx I be tie to talk to they to get they to address these situation as well and be hope they will resolve it but its now seem to be a pattern and I have hear from other who have this credit card   and other credit card   that they experience this as well I do not know if its just error in these company   system or if it be purposeful as a way for they to collect late fee and interest charge from unsuspecting customer I be lucky in that I be familiar with consumer protection law and so know how to call they and challenge they but I worry that many consumer will not notice or will not know how to challenge they and so just pay they I be wonder if other have complain about this to cfpb and so perhaps it be in fact a pattern that require investigation thank you for your time and consideration and for all you do to help protect consumer across the country   \n",

payment to an online retailer use chase quick pay with xxxx on the chase website I realize that this be a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regard the order and contact chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt get a refund through the retailer bank \\n\\n I contact chase via a secured message on   explain what happen and ask   be there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give I more information about the recipient   that xxxx my message be review and I receive a response restate my original email and inform I that   the transfer have be complete however as you mention that the website be a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you well in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team   I call the number list in the email and explain my situation to then be transfer to the claims department I be direct to call xxxx and ask they about the transaction because chase do not have any information outside of what I provide when initiate the transfer I feel like this agent be try to get I to end the call as quickly as possible and I have to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and do not have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask xxxx or what word and phrase I should use to get the information I be look for \\n\\n I call xxxx who s automated system initially direct I to call my bank because I use the bank app to initiate the transaction I call xxxx again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they tell I that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because I use the bank app to perform the transaction she stay on the line with I until I understand everything that I should ask and have a well understanding of the situation I end the call and call chase again \\n\\n when I call chase the second time the agent try to look up the information about the receive bank but could not find any additional information she then ask I why I need this information and I explain my situation again I be once again transfer to the claim department who tell I that I need to contact xxxx to get the information I be look for after I tell she that I have already contact they she finally admit that there be nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction be not secure she say that chase have no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputte and that the recipient bank information be not keep in the system in both phone call they ask if I initiate that transaction and use that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter \\n\\n during this whole process it feel like chase be not transparent about their policy regard these type of transaction nor be they helpful in help I get any information about the situation these transaction be advertise as a   fast safe and easy way to send money   but seem to be a dangerous way to do business I feel deceive by chase s advertising and far victimize by the way I be treat by the member on their customer service team   \n",

arbitration   despite that never be something I have agree to and never be a part of any contract between I and they  \\n\\n they do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequence   many other people I ve see who have have a similar problem be afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out   and even more egregiously despite chase simply send an email do this they require I to mail they a letter with my personal information enclose in order to opt out \\n\\n this be clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that be

payment in full and notation that i would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which i have received this reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end \\n\\nall subsequent payments have been made on time and as of xxxxxxxx the account has a  balance due to charges made after payment in full

not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges they stated that the  credit bureau unit  was not currently open and requested i call back the next day and request to speak to the unit as they would be able to to correct the information \\n\\ni followed the advice and spoke with xxxx cbu specialist in the xxxx mo call center after a long period of discussion xxxx informed me that there was nothing that he could do to update the file and remove the late payment reporting to the bureau \\n\\nafter requesting all notation on my file he advised i send a fax to the

me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to xxxx customer service \\n\\nin speaking with xxxx in customer service i believed that i was still speaking to the credit bureau department i recalled all events she confirmed the notation in the account additionally i advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on xxxxxxxx my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all chase accounts i was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account i received a screen that stated that i needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbersemail that were prepopulated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information i had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once i was able to gain access into the account i confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the default contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information \\n\\ni explained to her that when i tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account she assisted with updating on her end had me log out and log back in to confirm that the correct information was now showing on my end as the default contact information \\n\\ngiven all of the challenges with the

be done i explained that i had already spoken with xxxx in that department and that i was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her she stated that the supervisors in that
